### Bolt Optimization

- When aggregating massive monthly data chunks, parallel processing via `Promise.all` can cause significant database locking and CPU overload, resulting in statement timeouts from PostgREST.
- Switched parallel `supabase.rpc` execution to a sequential `await` execution model within a try/catch loop. This slightly increases client wait time but guarantees transaction completion by relieving the concurrent pressure on the PostgreSQL execution planner.
