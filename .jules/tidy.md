**Learning:** Repetitive blocks of logic for initializing default filter dates based on `lastSalesDate` were found across multiple view initialization functions (Innovations, Branch, Estrelas, etc.). This makes updating the fallback logic error-prone if it needs to change in the future.
**Action:** Created a centralized helper function `getDefaultFilterDates(lastSalesDate)` to return `currentYear` and `currentMonth`. This reduced repetition and improved consistency across the application. Replaced inline duplication with standard destructuring `const { currentYear, currentMonth } = getDefaultFilterDates(lastSalesDate);`.
